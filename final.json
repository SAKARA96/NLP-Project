He got some useful support from Nicol, Brendon and Williamson on the way. The SA bowlers were good but were defending a total which was under par. They will look to do better in the 2nd match at Hamilton.",

    "data": "A couple of partnerships was all it needed for South Africa to chase this target and they got exactly that. They were in a bit of bother when they lost their first 3 wickets but de Villiers and JP Duminy put on a steady stand and built a solid platform. Runs were coming mainly in singles and doubles but the asking rate was never allowed to climb beyond comfort. Duminy fell but du Plessis walked in and played his shots, helping himself to a fifty in company of his skipper (who reached a century himself). In the end, it turned out to be a comfortable victory for the visitors.",

New Zealand will rue the batting collapse that took place in the batting powerplay. This total was below-par on a flat track and Amla ensured that South Africa suffered no serious hiccups. His 92 oozed with class and he was helped by some poor fielding from the Kiwis. Nicol dropped him once while Ryder dropped Duminy. Nethula impressed with two wickets but in the end, Brendon McCullum had a poor score to defend.",

Amla was at his supreme best as he stroked his 18th fifty. Parnell and Albie Morkel also chipped in with some good knocks. New Zealand made a fight of it towards the end but the result was never in doubt.",

Getting 108 was always easy, but they lost quick wickets initially, but Joyce and Kevin O'Brien held the innings together with a solid stand to ensure there were no further hiccups in the chase. Kenya were outclassed in all the departments today and they will be looking to put up a much improved performance in the next match tomorrow.",

Defending a low total, they struck at regular intervals to put pressure on Kenya. But C Obuya and Mishra fought pretty well and revived them a bit with a 50 run stand for the 3rd wicket. After C Obuya got out, they missed the trick and lost wickets at regular intervals to lose the match by a narrow margin. Once again Dockrell was the pick of the bowlers. Overall, Ireland will be satisfied by their performance in this tour.",

Tamim set up the run chase perfectly for Bangladesh with a half century. Shakib Al Hasan then battled until the end but his partners deserted him and he had to fight as the lone ranger for his team. At the end it was the Gulldozer who came out on top and really just bowled his side to victory courtesy those terrific reverse swinging yorkers.",

Sri Lanka failed to put up a challenging total on the board and despite making a few early inroads, the total was just not enough. Umar Akmal and Misbah steadied the ship after those quick losses and really took their side through till the end. Akmal perished in the process of trying to secure the bonus point but Hammad Azam came in and struck the 5th ball that he faced to the fence to secure that extra point. Sri Lanka have had a dismal Asia Cup so far and now they are more or less out of the tournament.",

Namibia were never in the game and the 2nd innings was just a mere formality for the Irish who certainly deserved their place in the mega event set to be held in September.

After losing 3 early wickets Samuels and Dwayne Bravo put together an important stand of 64 for the 4th wicket, but Christian provided the much needed breathrough by removing Bravo and rest of the batsmen soon followed him by playing some loose shots. Sammy showed some fight towards the end, but he had ran out of partners and he was the last batsman to get out.",

The bowlers did a great job to restrict the Aussies, and the batsmen backed it up with a good show. Powell fell early and the top order got starts. They lost a few wickets in the middle but Dwayne Bravo and Pollard put on a 64 run stand for the 5th wicket to seal the game. Bravo fell towards the end, but Pollard and Baugh finished the game.",

Warner departed in the first over, but both the aforementioned batsmen played the big shots with ease to bring down the required run rate. Narine was the pick of the bowlers as he went for just 21 runs in 4 overs, but could not pick any wickets. Overall a bullying win for Australia",

However, some brilliant fielding from Dwayne Bravo resulted in Warner being run-out and West Indies came back in the game. Marlon Samuels and Fidel bowled a wonderful 18th and 19th over as they took wickets and gave away few runs.

Ontong played a blinder at the end to boost the score above the 200 mark. During India's chase, Gambhir playing some sublime strokes to help India stay on par even as Uthappa, at the other end, struggled to time the ball well. Although the required rate was high, India were looking set to get close to it. Unfortunately, rain had the final laugh, and it meant that South Africa won the game. They haven't had much luck with the Duckworth and Lewis in the past, but today it went their way.",

    "data": "A clinical performance from England today has helped them rout WI by a comfortable margin. Chasing 288 was tough and West Indies needed one batsman to score big, but that didn't happen even though Smith started off aggressively and got to a quickfire fifty. None of the other batsmen supported him well and rain arrived to stop the game. Upon resumption, Samuels started off well with some big hits, but they soon lost wickets in a heap and folded up cheaply. Darren Bravo also came down the order because of a groin injury and that didn't help their cause. England go one up in this 3-match series.",

    "data": "West Indies never seemed to be in the game, even when Dwayne Bravo, Keiron Pollard and Darren Sammy scored some quick runs in their batting powerplay. It was England throughout the day starting with some splendid swing bowling by Anderson, Finn and Broad and ending with some clinical one day batting by Cook, Bell and Trott. The target could have been tricky if they had lost a few early wickets, but Bell and Cook did not give even half chances for the visitors to grab. Cook played a few eye-catching and aggressive strokes and scored his 5th ODI ton. Narine failed to inspire once again and the rest of the bowlers, save for Best, looked flat throughout the day.",

  {
    "data": "A high scoring game and England emerge winners once again. 173 was a stiff target but Bopara and Hales made it look too easy. They ran hard, converted singles into doubles and kept finding the boundary regularly. Hales deserved a century but fell agonisingly short by just 1 run, but did enough to ensure a win for England.",

  {
    "data": "This is now the lowest T20 total in Sri Lanka. The hosts have really fought very well to defend what looked to be a modest total. Pakistan's batting was all over the place and none of the batsmen looked very comfortable against the short delivery. Kulasekara gave his side the perfect start by taking two wickets off the first two balls of the chase. Ahmed Shehzad finished up as the highest scorer amongst both teams but his innings of 36 came at a snail's pace and lasted 42 balls. Yet again Pakistan have bowled well but haven't finished up on top owing to some poor shot selection. Some credit obviously has to be given to Sri Lanka for their bowling and sharpness in the field.",

The bowling was superb by either sides with Sami joining the party with some outstanding pace. Afridi has to be the story of the day, he came in with Pakistan struggling. His fifty propelled the visitors to a fighting total which was a bridge too far for the visitors on a difficult track.",

    "data": "A clinical performance has helped Pakistan win this match by 6 wickets. Chasing a low total, they lost Azhar Ali and Younis early, but Hafeez and Misbah held the innings together with a fifty plus stand, which was instrumental in their win today. With this win, Pakistan have now won 9 of their past 11 ODIs against Sri Lanka. This match also will be remembered as one of the longest matches played as it was interrupted thrice by rain today and not many overs were reduced. Sri Lanka's batting let them down and they will hope to put up a much better performance in the next ODI.",

    "data": "Convincing and clinical showing by Sri Lanka. After the mediocre performance in the first ODI, the batsmen came back well to put on a score of 280. Dilshan batted really well, carrying his bat through and in the process scored a hundred. Pakistan looked to be in the game when Misbah and Azhar Ali were batting in the middle, but once the skipper fell, the other batsmen followed him back to the pavilion. After Umar Akmal had to return back thanks to a horrendous decision, the onus was on Afridi to take his side home. But a brilliant catch from Sangakkara sent him back for just 17 and the game pretty much ended then and there.",

  {
    "data": "What a game this has been. Indeed it has been a great exhibition for the 50 over game. Pakistan, for the second time in the series, were coasting along in the middle overs. Like in the 2nd ODI, it was the skipper Misbah and Azhar Ali who were anchoring the chase. But unfortunately for them, the batting powerplay turned out to be a nightmare as they lost Misbah and then Umar Akmal during that passage of play. It only went from bad to worse as Thissara Perera proceeded to pick a hat-trick in the 41st over and Pakistan collapsed from 166/2 to 199 all out. Perera once again shone through with 4 wickets, but you have got to hand it to Mahela's intuitive captaincy. He kept the pressure on the visitors despite a 113 run 3rd wicket stand. Azhar Ali once again was the lone ranger and carried his bat through, scoring an unbeaten and defiant 81 in the process.",
    "label": 5
  },
  {
    "data": "Sri Lanka stuttered in their chase early as they lost their openers without doing much damage. Then Sanga and Chandimal stitched a partnership and they found it hard to negotiate the spinners in the middle overs. Misbah lost the plot before the toss only when he left out Ajmal and got in Sami in his place. This pitch was conducive for spin bowling and they were one spinner short. They were also pretty ordinary in the field and too many runs were conceded as a result of which Sri Lankans got away when they needed runs. Mathews played an innings of substance as he single-handedly took his team through even though he lost partners at the other end. Sami's figures are the most expensive by a Pakistani in Sri Lanka.",

  {
    "data": "It has been a commanding performance from South Africa. Ashraful played some good strokes but he played a loose shot and was dismissed. The middle order failed to put up much of a fight. Mahmudullah and Rahim sparkled towards the end. Rahim capitalized on some bad bowling from Wayne Parnell as he scored a fifty. The South Africans were a bit off the boil in the final overs and they will look to overcome that.",

    "data": "What a performance by Zimbabwe. Mpofu bowled wonderfully at the start. He cleverly mixed his pace and the South African batsmen found the going tough. Cremer then flummoxed the Proteas with his leg breaks and googly. Colin Ingram put up a bit of a fight after surviving a dropped chance on 0.

They looked a better unit today and their fielding and bowling was much better than the previous matches. Parnell was the the pick of the bowlers, taking 3 for 16 from his 4 overs and that was the difference between the two sides today. SA had to chase down the target in 15 overs to knock Zimbabwe out of the tournament, but ZIM spinners bowled some tight overs in the middle to make sure they reach the finals.",

Taylor led the way with a captain's knock, he was all class today, wonder why he is never considered for a contract in any T20 franchises across the world? That is for later though, Masakadza was scratchy but did well to stay and aid his skipper. Good practise ahead of the T20 WC for them. Gary Kirsten and Allan Donald will have some work, SA did miss some of their stars but their efforts were patchy in this tournament.",

    "data": "An easy win in the end for England. They bowled well as a unit and successfully defended the total. After they were put in by Australia, they got off to a solid start, but lost quick wickets in the middle. Morgan took the centre stage thereafter and played an incredible innings to help England to a decent total. Australia lost Watson cheaply, but Warner and Bailey stitched together a solid partnership. They lost both set batsmen quickly and only Clarke showed some character in the middle, with the other batsmen failing to make any valuable contribution. Wade was playing well for his 27, but a terrible mix-up in the middle cut short his innings and that was the last nail in the coffin for Australia.",

New Zealand always needed someone to play right through the match and strike at a good rate, however, they were always left wanting.

Sabbir Rahman's red-hot form yielded to some Afridi magic but there just weren't enough runs in the bank.

He steered the chase almost single-handedly during that middle period, getting boundaries at regular intervals to ease the pressure of the run-rate. He finally found some support from Jadeja and their partnership sealed the game for the visitors.

So quickly that Dinesh Karthik never got the time to think his strategies. Punjab's death bowling had been a concern so far in the tournament but today things were a bit different.
